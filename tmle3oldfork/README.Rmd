> The _Extensible_ TMLE framework

__Author:__ [Jeremy Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle)

## What's `tmle3`?

`tmle3` is a general framework that supports the implementation of a range of
Targeted Maximum Likelihood / Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE) parameters
through exposing a unified interface. The goal is that the `tmle3` framework
be as general as the mathematical framework upon which it's based.

For a general discussion of the framework of targeted minimum loss-based
estimation and the role this methodology plays in statistical and causal
inference, the canonical references are @vdl2011targeted and @vdl2018targeted.

## Installation

<!--
For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hal9001) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hal9001")
```
-->

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `tmle3` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/tmle3")
```

---

## Getting Started

The best place to get started is the "Framework Overview" document, which
describes the individual components of the `tmle3` framework. It may be found at
https://tlverse.org/tmle3/articles/framework.html.
